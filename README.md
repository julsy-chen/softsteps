Scenario:
My client will be myself. Throughout high school, my client has struggled with their time management and how to keep my motivation high throughout the school year. They use a daily to-do list for motivation and stay on top of their tasks. The to-do list has increased their productivity, but they have recently noticed that it will only happen when the tasks are broken down to very small steps so there is minimal struggle with starting their work. As a result, my client will often have days where they spend too much time creating a to-do list and end up using the to-do list almost like a pass or excuse to not complete work. In contrast, without a to-do list, they cannot imagine the workload for the day which results in procrastinating for the day because of a lack of motivation. Fixing this problem would benefit them greatly because they would be able to use it throughout their day-to-day life, and not only just for academic purposes, but also for errands and chores. 

Rationale for Proposed Solution:
The proposed solution is a to-do list web application with the ability to automatically generate subtasks using AI to fulfill the need for tasks to be broken down. With this, my client will no longer waste time breaking down tasks manually and instead, they can immediately start working. I chose to create a web application because my client uses the Google Calendar website for time management meaning they will already have their laptop out. Therefore, this is the most convenient and efficient way for them to access their to-do list. The web application will use React, a JavaScript library, because of its ability to develop a dynamic single-page interface. Additionally, React was chosen because of its component-based framework, making it easy to manage UI elements. This structure will work well with nesting components together to form the UI. For the backend, I will implement Firebase Firestore, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, that provides real-time syncing across sessions. Firestore can automatically save and load data in after refreshing or opening the application. Furthermore, Firebase works well with React to support data ordering, updates, and document subcollections. The document subcollections will be helpful when handling nested data structures like subtasks under a task. Then, to generate subtasks based on user input, I will use the Gemini API from Googleâ€™s Generative AI toolkit. Additionally, Python with FastAPI is used for the backend because it supports fast, asynchronous requests, handles JSON efficiently, and interacts well with React for creating lightweight APIs.
